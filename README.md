# Fuse Filesystems in Go

This is simple fork of <http://github.com/seaweedfs/fuse> (which is a fork of <http://bazil.org/fuse>) that uses fuse3 instead of fuse2.

This has only had very simple refactoring done to it so most things _should_ work, that being said I'm not exactly sure what has changed between fuse3 and fuse2 so some things may not work, or work as intended. I'm more then happy to try to fix any bugs or issues that arise, though they may take longer then normal to fix as I'm not familiar with the codebase.
